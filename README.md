# php_CRUD_project
In this repository, I have created CRUD operation using PHP as backend with mysql database.

# what you need to use
You have to use html, css, and PHP etc.
Here we are just letting the admin add, delete or update the user i.e to perform CRUD operation using Sql database.

# Level
Basic
It is very simple and important projects of php and mysql.
So you can add this app in your resume as well.

# How to use this code on your projects
You can simply download every files from github and after that you have to run that file using xampp server and you also need to make database table by yourself 
before executing this project.

Why i need to make database table by myself?
=because before creating this project at first i have created database table according to this projects needs. So now when u will copy this code
it will not directly run on your computer means you can't see any data in your database becz before that you need to make database table.

NOTE: I will provide the easiest technique of copying my database table to your database very soon...
